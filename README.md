> [!Project Context]
> This project is part of an academic assignment for undergraduate students pursuing a degree in computer science. It was developed as part of a university course, aimed at designing a real-time air traffic simulator. The goal was to apply theoretical concepts from software engineering, real-time systems, and computer graphics to create a functional and interactive simulation of air traffic management.

---

Objective
This project is a real-time air traffic simulator designed to automatically model and manage aircraft movement and airport operations. It simulates complex scenarios including multiple flights, real-time flight trajectories, collision risk management, and unforeseen events such as aviation emergencies.

---

Features
* Simulation visualization
Real-time display of date and time to follow the progress of the simulation.
2. Airport Monitoring
Visualization of airports, display of their data: name, total number of runways, planes ready to take off.
3. Aircraft Tracking
Visualization of aircraft in flight with their key information (altitude, speed, distance traveled, departure and arrival airports, departure/arrival times).
4. Airplane Trajectories in Real Time
Real-time trajectory displayed with a solid line for the completed route and a dotted line for the remaining route.
5. Adjustable Simulation Speed
Ability to increase or decrease the speed of the simulation.
6. Collision Detection and Avoidance
Automatic collision risk management: reduction of an aircraft's speed to avoid an accident.
7. Generation of Emergency Events
Rare events such as breakdowns or medical emergencies may occur, resulting in an emergency landing.

How the Simulator Works (controls) :
Background: Displays a map showing airports and airplanes in flight.
Trajectory: Shows the flight paths of the planes.
Grid: Toggles the map's grid view.
Relief: Click the "Relief" button to display geographical features such as mountains and elevations on the map.
Pause: Click the pause button to stop the simulation.
Resume: Click the pause button again to resume the simulation.
Speed Adjustment: Use the "speed +" and "speed -" buttons to adjust the speed of the simulation.
Data Visualization:
Airports: Click on an airport to view its data, including its name, number of runways, and the number of planes ready for takeoff.
Planes: Click on a plane in flight to view its details, such as altitude, speed, remaining fuel percentage, departure/arrival airports, and departure/arrival times.
