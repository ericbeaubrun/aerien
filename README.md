This project is a real-time air traffic simulator designed to automatically model and manage aircraft movement and airport operations. It simulates complex scenarios including multiple flights, real-time flight trajectories, collision risk management, and unforeseen events such as aviation emergencies.

Features
* Simulation visualization
Real-time display of date and time to follow the progress of the simulation.
2. Airport Monitoring
Visualization of airports, display of their data: name, total number of runways, planes ready to take off.
3. Aircraft Tracking
Visualization of aircraft in flight with their key information (altitude, speed, distance traveled, departure and arrival airports, departure/arrival times).
4. Airplane Trajectories in Real Time
Real-time trajectory displayed with a solid line for the completed route and a dotted line for the remaining route.
5. Adjustable Simulation Speed
Ability to increase or decrease the speed of the simulation.
6. Collision Detection and Avoidance
Automatic collision risk management: reduction of an aircraft's speed to avoid an accident.
7. Generation of Emergency Events
Rare events such as breakdowns or medical emergencies may occur, resulting in an emergency landing.
